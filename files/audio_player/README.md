foobar2000
==========
This is my configuration of foobar2000. Navigating through artists and albums is accomplished by double clicking it's title or picture. 

To use the Winamp visualisation wrapper Shpeck, go to Preferences>Visualisations>Shpeck.
The Winamp directory is the folder called "shpeck" inside the parent folder.

fcl panel configuration is located in %ps_foobar2000_path%\themes\lur\.

Updating to the latest release of foobar2000 is accomplished by running the official installer in portable mode and pointing it to the foobar2000 directory.

Credit goes to the original authors for their work which I adapted for my configuration:
